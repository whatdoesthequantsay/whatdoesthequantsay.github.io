Many people seem to think that blockchain technology [would help with
DRM][reason] ( or "content protection”) because blockchain tech (the
Bitcoin usecase in particular) proved for the first time that creating
digital scarcity is possible, and DRM is fundamentally about enforcing
digital scarcity. [Some are envisioning][slate] that just as a bitcoin
can have its ownership transferred from one person to another there
must be a way to do the same with a media file.

However, there is a fundamental difference between the scarcity of a
bitcoin and the (envisioned) scarcity of a music file. In the case of
Bitcoin all the participants in the system agree that bitcoins should
be scarce, as the very operation of the system relies on this
scarcity. It’s perfectly possible to change the Bitcoin software (it
is software after all) so that anyone can copy their Bitcoin balance
and give the copied balance to someone else. If a majority of
participants were to agree to make this change it could be rolled out
through a software update, and people could now "share" bitcoins
freely with one another. The chance of a majority of participants
choosing to implement this "feature" would of course be low as the
Bitcoin currency would quickly hyperinflate and lose all its value. In
short people have an economic incentive to preserve the scarcity which
translates to social pressure to preserve the scarcity.

By contrast, in the music file case there is no direct disincentive
for end-users to copy a file. If I have a copy of Taylor Swifts "Shake
it Off" and I give a copy to you, I can still enjoy the tune, and you
can too. If you then give a copy to your friend it doesn’t diminish my
enjoyment of the song.

Not only is there no economic incentive to preserve the scarcity in
the music file case, there is an (at least short-term) economic
incentive (for media consumers) in the opposite direction: In
file-sharing networks you often get rewarded for sharing copies of
files you have with copies of files you don’t already have. Add to
that a subculture where groups compete to be the first to "release"
(or break the DRM of) a music or video file, and you have a strong (at
least sub-cultural) social pressure working against DRM and against
digital scarcity.

Where blockchain technology could help however is to lower the barrier
between the artist and the end-user of the content. Right now there is
a byzantine layer of corporate bureaucracy between artist and music
fan. The blockchain can help cut out a lot of that complexity and
bring the artist and fan closer together where the listener can
directly pay the artist in a simple, fair and transparent way without
going through layers of ossified corporations and conglomerates.

This might ultimately be the best weapon to deal with the issues of
piracy: If the music fan no longer has to pay a middleman or large
corporation through a cumbersome process to access the music of their
favorite artist they will likely be much more willing to support the
artist financially.
