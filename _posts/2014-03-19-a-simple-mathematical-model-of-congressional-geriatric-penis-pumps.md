Last week's hysterical report by the Daily Show's Samantha Bee on
[federally funded penis pumps](http://thedailyshow.cc.com/videos/pvhtvo/federally-funded-penis-pumps)
contained a quote which piqued our quantitative interest.  Listen
carefully at the 4:00 mark, when
[Ilyse Hogue](http://www.thenation.com/authors/ilyse-hogue) proclaims
authoritatively:

> *"Statistics show that probably some our members of congress have a
> vested interested in having penis pumps covered by Medicare!"*

Ilya's wording is vague, and intentionally so.  Statistically, a lot
of things are "probably" true, and many details are contained in the
word "probably".  In this post we present a simple statistical model
to clarify what Ilya means.

First we state our assumptions.  We assume that penis pumps are
uniformly distributed among male Medicare recipients and that no man
has received two pumps. These are relatively mild assumptions.  We
also assume that what Ilya refers to as "members of Congress [with] a
vested interested in having penis pumps covered by Medicare,"
specifically means male member of congress who received a penis pump
covered by federal funds.  Of course, one could argue that female
members congress could also have a vested interested in penis pumps as
well, but we do ***not*** want to get into that.

Now the number crunching. According to the report, Medicare has spent
a total of $172 million supplying penis pumps to recipients, at "360
bucks a pop."  This means a total of 478,000 penis pumps bought from
2006 to 2011.

[45% of the current 49,435,610 Medicare recipients are male](http://kff.org/medicare/state-indicator/medicare-beneficiaries-by-gender).
In other words, Medicare bought one penis pump for every 46.5
eligible men.  Inverting this, we can say that 2.15% of male
Medicare recipients received a penis pump.

There are currently 128 members of congress (32 senators plus 96
representatives) who are males over the age of 65 and therefore
Medicare-eligible.  The probability that none of them received a
federally funded penis pump is:

$$(1 - .0215)^{128} \approx 6.19\%$$

In other words, the chances of *at least one* member of congress
having said penis pumps is 93.8%, which is just shy of the 95%
confidence that most statisticians agree on as significant.  In order
to get to 95% confidence, we need a total of 138 male members of
congress who are over the age of 65, and this has not happened yet as
of 2014.  Nevertheless, the estimate is close enough for us to agree
with Ilya that there is *probably* someone member of congress who has
one.

Is it possible that there two or more penis pump recipients in
congress?  We did notice that Ilya's quote refers to plural members of
congress.  Under the assumptions laid out above, the probability of
having *at least two* federally funded penis pumps in congress is:

$$ 1 - \binom{128}{0}(1-.0215)^{128} - \binom{128}{1}(1-.0215)^{127}(.0215)^1 \approx 76.3\%.$$

Again, we would say this is *probably* true, though not nearly with
the same amount of confidence as before.  In order to reach 95%
confidence that there are two or moreq congressional federally funded
penis pump, we would need 200 or more Medicare-eligible males in
congress, which is unlikely to happen anytime soon.

*Note: As a corollary to these calculations, I became the first
developer in the history of mankind to type the following command:
`git merge --squash penispump`.*
